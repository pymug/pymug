website source of pymug.com - python mauritius user group

NOTE: As noted on fb and linked-in, joining our groups on social media adds you as a member on our website. Joining our groups is about commitment to Python. A personal page is created for you with your skills listed. It shows at the very least the path to learn py.

# Website
https://pymug.github.io/pymug/ or http://www.pymug.com

# Structure
the site's structure is dictated by github pages' specifications and handling rather than good standards.

an index.html in every folder, path or lib, is a brillant idea of github (really). See tutorial section below
